Blendgen creates synthetic data that is usable for generative video and video captioning tasks. The data consists of videos and captions. The videos are generated using Blender, a 3D modeling software.

For example, a video could be:

## üñ•Ô∏è Setup

1. Download Blender. If you're on Linux, set it up with this script:

```bash
bash scripts/install_blender_linux.sh
```

2. If you're on a headless Linux server, install Xorg and start it:

```bash
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg -y && \
  sudo python3 scripts/start_x_server.py start
```

3. Install the Python dependencies. Note that Python >3.8 is required:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .
```

4. Download the datasets:
```bash
./scripts/get_data.sh
```

## üì∏ Usage

## Generating Combinations

```bash
python3 blendgen/combiner.py --count 1000 --seed 42
```

## Batching

After setup, we can start to render objects using the `batch.py` script:

```bash
python3 blendgen/batch.py --start_index 0 --end_index 1000 --width 1024 --height 576
```
